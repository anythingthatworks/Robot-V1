# Robot-V1

V2
reworked one way platforms to not need their own update functions by rolling that functionality into the player

V3
Added batteries, the ability to pick them up and throw them, and their ability to snap to grid
side notes for batteries: at the moment they do reduce your jump and change your hitbox, both of these seem interesting and worth investigating as mechanics
Also modified the movement script to allow you to juimp of batteries
and modified the game manager to store dimensions for the grid
